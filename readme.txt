Create a Quiz. A very easy to use and feature rich plugin to create an unlimited amount of quizzes and embed them on to any page or post.

== Description ==

ICN Academy. The easiest way to create fun quizzes for you site
======

ICN Academy is a very easy to use plugin to create an unlimited amount of quizzes and embed them onto any page or post. ICN Academy is equally perfect for building strong professional based questionnaires or fun Buzzfeed style quizzes.

= NOTICE ⚠️ =
The 1.8.x version is a major upgrade. Your quiz and question data will need to be upgraded if you are upgrading ICN Academy from an earlier version. If you have less than 60 questions this will be done automatically in the background. However, if you have more, you will need to use the manual upgrade tool (don't worry; it's just a click of a button).

If you have any issues with upgrading to this version, please contact me on my support forum so I can help you. [view the ICN Academy plugin page](https://coinvestasi.com/ "view the ICN Academy plugin page")

Upgrading does not modify or delete your old quiz data in any way, so you can also always revert back to a previous version of ICN Academy [here](https://coinvestasi.com/ "download older version of ICN Academy") (download link is at the bottom of the page).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Using an image already in my library =

WordPress will NOT create the new thumbnail size for images that existed before the installation of ICN Academy, only new ones. This is likely because on larger sites, this would take up vast amounts of server resources.

If you do not wish to simply re-upload any desired image from your library, then I would recommend using the [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/ "Regenerate Thumbnails") plugin (over 1 Million active installs). It will go through and recreate thumbnails for every single image in your library, ensuring that all images in your library can be used with ICN Academy.

With that said, I do, however, have plans to integrate a solution that will work with images uploaded before the installation of ICN Academy.

= What's the difference between WP Pagination and jQuery Pagination? Which should I use? =

Unless you are a unique situation, I'd almost always recommend using jQuery Pagination as it provides more control for you and a better experience for your users. WP Pagination should only be used if you are trying to increase your overall page views for ad revenue or something similar.

More information can be found on the ICN Academy About / Options page.

= I have a feature request! =
Fantastic! I'm one of those coders who loves a good challenge. Please submit your feature request here by using the **support** tab or leave a request of the [official ICN Academy plugin page](https://coinvestasi.com/ "view the ICN Academy plugin page").
